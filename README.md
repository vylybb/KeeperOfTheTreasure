# Keeper of the Treasure
A simple Java-Service that offers reports and alerts to monitor a trading-portfolio.
It is using Interactive-Brokers TWS.

## The origin 
This project was originally intended to meet the specific requirements of a client.
A subset of this functionality (plus some additional features) made its way then into the version you find in this repo.

I am thinking about enhancing it in the future.
If you have ideas for more features or other suggestions, just get in touch.
